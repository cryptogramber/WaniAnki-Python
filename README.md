# WaniAnki-Python
Python scripts to parse WaniKani kanji &amp; vocabulary JSON dumps into Anki decks w/kanji stroke orders.

Uses:
- genanki: https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki
- kanji stroke order font: http://www.nihilist.org.uk/
- Pillow: https://python-pillow.org/ (the stroke order .pngs are included in this repo; you can remove this part if desired)

See WaniKani's API documentation for pulling kanji/vocabulary data: https://www.wanikani.com/api (a WaniKani account API key is required)

Note: WaniKani is great and you should support them with a subscription. This is for extra practice, especially with regard to writing kanji w/a stroke order reference. Please don't use this to avoid supporting WaniKani.
